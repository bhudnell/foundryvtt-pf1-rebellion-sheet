        attempt a DC 20 Secrecy check and spend 50 gp to smuggle goods and bribe
        officials. On a successful check, the Silver Ravens set up a black
        market for 1 week in Kintargo. During this week, the city’s base value
        is doubled and all rolls to determine item availability increase from
        75% to 90%. Furthermore, magic items sold to the black market sell for
        55% of their normal price rather than 50%. On a failed check, your
        Notoriety score increases by 1d6.</p>

        <p>Team: Saboteurs, Spies, or Thieves</p><p>Your outlaw team secures a
        small building somewhere in Kintargo and sets it up as a safe house. You
        can select any building for this role, provided the building is not
        located in the Castle District or the Greens (final selection subject to
        GM approval). The building itself might be abandoned, or it might be a
        home or humble business run by a rebellion supporter. An activated safe
        house remains active for 1 week, during which time any characters
        recovered via the Rescue Character action can be brought to the site
        without fear. The building also presents a safe place to get food,
        recover, and rest without worrying about wandering monsters or other
        interruptions. A cache hidden in an active safe house can’t be lost by
        the Cache Discovered event. Finally, for each active safe house, the
        rebellion gains a cumulative +1 bonus on Security checks, to a maximum
        bonus of +5.</p>

        <p>Team: Saboteurs, Sneaks, Spies, or Thieves</p><p>You can arrange for
        a cache of equipment to be hidden somewhere in Kintargo. Doing so
        requires purchasing the items in question (or simply providing the team
        with items already owned) and a successful Secrecy check to stash the
        items. Caches come in three categories—minor, intermediate, and major
        (see below). Sneaks can only secure minor caches, while thieves can
        secure minor or intermediate caches, and both saboteurs and spies can
        secure all three categories. You can have the team secure an outdoor
        cache in any location in Kintargo (such caches are typically hidden in
        alleys or parks or other relatively out-of-the-way areas) or inside a
        specific structure. When placed in a specific structure, the cache is
        typically hidden near the entrance, but additional locations are
        available in certain buildings. (Your GM has this information as it is
        needed.) Placing a cache inside of “enemy territory” (subject to the GM)
        increases the DC by 5 to 10. Make sure to keep track of the locations
        you’ve hidden caches and what kinds of caches they are! See the sidebar
        above for DCs and additional details on the three
        categories.</p><h3>Caches</h3><p>A cache is a small, hidden stash of
        supplies placed in a strategic location for later use. Most caches
        consist of healing and other restorative magic, but any combination of
        items fitting the overall restrictions can be
        stashed.</p><p><strong>Minor Cache:</strong> A minor cache can weigh no
        more than 5 pounds, and can be worth no more than 900 gp in all.
        Securing a minor cache requires a DC 15 Secrecy
        check.</p><p><strong>Intermediate Cache:</strong> An intermediate cache
        can weigh no more than 10 pounds, and can be worth no more than 2,500 gp
        in all. Securing an intermediate cache requires a DC 20 Secrecy
        check.</p><p><strong>Major Cache:</strong> A major cache can weigh no
        more than 20 pounds, but can be worth any amount. Using a bag of
        holding, portable hole, or similar extradminsional storage item expands
        the weight limit of major caches. Securing a major cache requires a DC
        30 Secrecy check.</p>

        deal with the results of a previous week’s event or a development in the
        course of an adventure. The nature of these Special actions vary wildly,
        and rules for how they work can be found in the event or development
        that calls for them.</p>

        <p>Team: Merchant Lords</p><p>By relying on contacts in other cities
        throughout the Inner Sea region, a team of merchant lords can place a
        special order for a specific expensive item that costs more than
        Kintargo’s base value and is not currently available in the city’s
        shops. The cost for the item in question must be paid up front (although
        the actual price includes a 5% discount due to the merchant lords’
        expertise at haggling), and it is delivered to Kintargo in 2d6 days.
        (For an additional cost of 900 gp, this delivery time can be reduced to
        1 day by having the item delivered by teleportation. This additional
        cost is equal to the cost of two teleport spells, since the deliverer’s
        return trip must also be accounted for.) The GM has final say on whether
        or not an item is available for special order.</p>
