        attempt a DC 20 Secrecy check and spend 50 gp to smuggle goods and bribe
        officials. On a successful check, the Silver Ravens set up a black
        market for 1 week in Kintargo. During this week, the city’s base value
        is doubled and all rolls to determine item availability increase from
        75% to 90%. Furthermore, magic items sold to the black market sell for
        55% of their normal price rather than 50%. On a failed check, your
        Notoriety score increases by 1d6.</p>

        <p>Team: Saboteurs, Spies, or Thieves</p><p>Your outlaw team secures a
        small building somewhere in Kintargo and sets it up as a safe house. You
        can select any building for this role, provided the building is not
        located in the Castle District or the Greens (final selection subject to
        GM approval). The building itself might be abandoned, or it might be a
        home or humble business run by a rebellion supporter. An activated safe
        house remains active for 1 week, during which time any characters
        recovered via the Rescue Character action can be brought to the site
        without fear. The building also presents a safe place to get food,
        recover, and rest without worrying about wandering monsters or other
        interruptions. A cache hidden in an active safe house can’t be lost by
        the Cache Discovered event. Finally, for each active safe house, the
        rebellion gains a cumulative +1 bonus on Security checks, to a maximum
        bonus of +5.</p>

        requires purchasing the items in question (or simply providing the team

        items. Caches come in three categories—minor, intermediate, and major
        (see the sidebar above). Sneaks can only secure minor caches, while
        thieves can secure minor or intermediate caches, and both saboteurs and
        spies can secure all three categories. You can have the team secure an
        outdoor cache in any location in Kintargo (such caches are typically
        hidden in alleys or parks or other relatively out-of-the-way areas) or
        inside a specific structure. When placed in a specific structure, the
        cache is typically hidden near the entrance, but additional locations
        are available in certain buildings. (Your GM has this information as it
        is needed.) Placing a cache inside of “enemy territory” (subject to the

        <p>Team: Merchant Lords</p><p>By relying on contacts in other cities
        throughout the Inner Sea region, a team of merchant lords can place a
        special order for a specific expensive item that costs more than
        Kintargo’s base value and is not currently available in the city’s
        shops. The cost for the item in question must be paid up front (although
        the actual price includes a 5% discount due to the merchant lords’
        expertise at haggling), and it is delivered to Kintargo in 2d6 days.
        (For an additional cost of 900 gp, this delivery time can be reduced to
        1 day by having the item delivered by teleportation. This additional
        cost is equal to the cost of two teleport spells, since the deliverer’s
        return trip must also be accounted for.) The GM has final say on whether
        or not an item is available for special order.</p>

        Notoriety score by an additional 1d6. If you fail the check by 5 or
        more, your Notoriety score is instead increased by 1d6.</p>

        upgraded team’s cost, you can upgrade a lower-tier team to that new type

        upgrade as many different teams as you can afford in gold and rebellion
        actions for that week.</p>
