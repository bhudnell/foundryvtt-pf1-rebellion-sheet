      <p>Randomly determine one of your teams that was committed to an action
      this week. That team accomplished its goal, but took some damage during
      the mission and became disabled. The team cannot be used for a rebellion
      action during the next week.</p><p>If no teams were committed to an action
      during the week, treat this event as a result of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-rebellion-sheet.events.Item.XYaqJw9bEeKA2UzS]{Dangerous
      Times}.</p><p>Mitigation: If you spend gold equal to your current minimum
      treasury value, you can restore the disabled team to full health.</p>
