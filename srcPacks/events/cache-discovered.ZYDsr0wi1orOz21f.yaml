    <p>Randomly determine one of your current caches hidden in Kintargo. That
    cache has been discovered, and its contents are lost. If you have no caches
    hidden at this time, Asmodean inquisitors instead capture some of your
    supporters; reduce your supporters and Kintargoâ€™s population by 1d6.</p>
