      <p>Randomly determine one of your current caches hidden in Kintargo. That
      cache has been discovered, and its contents are lost. If you have no
      caches hidden at this time, Asmodean inquisitors instead capture some of
      your supporters; reduce your supporters and Kintargo’s population by
      1d6.</p>
