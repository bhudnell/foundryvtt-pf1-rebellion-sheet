  description:
    value: >-
      <p>Choose two random teams; those teams have developed an unhealthy but
      temporary rivalry. During the next Activity phase, you can’t use either of
      these teams to take actions. If you roll Rivalry twice in one Event phase,
      it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens officer makes
      a DC 20 Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check to deal with the rivalry, it
      ends.</p>
