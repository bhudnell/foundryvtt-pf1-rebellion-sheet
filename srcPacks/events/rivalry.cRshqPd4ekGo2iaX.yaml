    <p>Choose two random teams; those teams have developed an unhealthy but
    temporary rivalry. During the next Activity phase, you canâ€™t use either of
    these teams to take actions. If you roll Rivalry twice in one Event phase,
    it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens officer makes a
    DC 20 Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check to deal with the rivalry, it
    ends.</p>
