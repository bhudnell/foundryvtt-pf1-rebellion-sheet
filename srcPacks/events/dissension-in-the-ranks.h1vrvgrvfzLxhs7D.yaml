    value: >-
      <p>Personality conflicts among the Silver Ravens have compromised
      cooperation. For the next week (including the next week’s events, if any),
      all Organization checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll Dissension in the
      Ranks twice in one Event phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation:
      If a Silver Ravens officer makes a successful DC 20 Diplomacy check to
      soothe over the dissension, this penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
