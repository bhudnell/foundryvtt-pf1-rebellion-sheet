    <p>One of your supporters is a snitch who has been leaking rumors and
    information about the Silver Ravens to House Thrune and the church of
    Asmodeus. Attempt a DC 15 Loyalty check. If you are successful, reduce your
    supporters by 1, but you need fear no further repercussions as your other
    loyal supporters have handled the situation. If you fail this Loyalty check,
    reduce your supporters by 1 and your Notoriety score increases by 1d6.</p>
