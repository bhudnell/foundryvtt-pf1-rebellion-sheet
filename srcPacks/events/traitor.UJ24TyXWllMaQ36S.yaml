    value: >-
      <p>One of the Silver Ravens is revealed to be a traitor! Randomly
      determine one team from all of your teams; that team is the one that
      housed the traitor. That team becomes disabled after the traitor is
      uncovered. If you make a successful DC 20 Loyalty check, the traitor has
      been discovered before he or she could significantly damage the Silver
      Ravens and you can either attempt to redeem, execute, exile, or imprison
      the traitor. If you fail this Loyalty check (or if you do not take any of
      the previously four mentioned responses), the traitor escapes and the
      Silver Ravens’ Notoriety score increases by 2d6.</p><p>If you wish to
      attempt to redeem a captured traitor, you must first imprison him or her,
      then take a Special Action during the next Activity phase, during which
      the Silver Ravens must make a successful DC 20 Loyalty check. If you
      succeed, the traitor changes allegiance, your disabled team is no longer
      disabled, and you need not fear an increase in your Notoriety score in the
      future from this particular one-time traitor. Each time you redeem a
      traitor in this way, you automatically gain 1d6 supporters at the start of
      the next Upkeep phase.</p><p>If you capture and execute the traitor, you
      prevent any increase in your Notoriety score but damage the Silver Ravens’
      morale, causing the rebels to suffer from a persistent Low Morale unless
      you make a successful DC 20 Loyalty check.</p><p>If you capture and wish
      to exile the traitor, you must make a successful DC 25 Security check to
      convince the traitor to never return to Kintargo. Failure results in an
      increase of 2d6 to your Notoriety score as the traitor sneaks back into
      the city to report to Barzillai Thrune.</p><p>If you capture and imprison
      the traitor, you must make a successful DC 20 Secrecy check during every
      Upkeep phase until you choose to execute, exile, or successfully redeem
      the traitor. If you fail this Secrecy check, the traitor escapes and the
      rebellion’s Notoriety score increases by 2d6.</p><p>If the Silver Ravens
      do not currently have any teams, treat this event as no event.</p>
