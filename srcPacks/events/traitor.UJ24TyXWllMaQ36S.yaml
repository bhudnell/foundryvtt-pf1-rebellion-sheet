  description: >-
    <p>One of the Silver Ravens is revealed to be a traitor! Randomly determine
    one team from all of your teams; that team is the one that housed the
    traitor. That team becomes disabled after the traitor is uncovered. If you
    make a successful DC 20 Loyalty check, the traitor has been discovered
    before he or she could significantly damage the Silver Ravens and you can
    either attempt to redeem, execute, exile, or imprison the traitor. If you
    fail this Loyalty check (or if you do not take any of the previously four
    mentioned responses), the traitor escapes and the Silver Ravens’ Notoriety
    score increases by 2d6.</p><p>If you wish to attempt to redeem a captured
    traitor, you must first imprison him or her, then take a Special Action
    during the next Activity phase, during which the Silver Ravens must make a
    successful DC 20 Loyalty check. If you succeed, the traitor changes
    allegiance, your disabled team is no longer disabled, and you need not fear
    an increase in your Notoriety score in the future from this particular
    one-time traitor. Each time you redeem a traitor in this way, you
    automatically gain 1d6 supporters at the start of the next Upkeep
    phase.</p><p>If you capture and execute the traitor, you prevent any
    increase in your Notoriety score but damage the Silver Ravens’ morale,
    causing the rebels to suffer from a persistent Low Morale unless you make a
    successful DC 20 Loyalty check.</p><p>If you capture and wish to exile the
    traitor, you must make a successful DC 25 Security check to convince the
    traitor to never return to Kintargo. Failure results in an increase of 2d6
    to your Notoriety score as the traitor sneaks back into the city to report
    to Barzillai Thrune.</p><p>If you capture and imprison the traitor, you must
    make a successful DC 20 Secrecy check during every Upkeep phase until you
    choose to execute, exile, or successfully redeem the traitor. If you fail
    this Secrecy check, the traitor escapes and the rebellion’s Notoriety score
    increases by 2d6.</p><p>If the Silver Ravens do not currently have any
    teams, treat this event as no event.</p>
