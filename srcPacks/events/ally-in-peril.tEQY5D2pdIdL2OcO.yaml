  description: >-
    <p>One of your allies, randomly determined, is put in peril. Attempt a
    Security check (DC = 20 – the ally’s level; minimum DC 10). If the check is
    a success, the ally is merely missing for a week. During the next Upkeep
    phase, attempt a new Security check against the same DC. If that check is
    successful, the ally returns with a harrowing story or the like of how he or
    she had to flee or lie low for a time, but if that check is a failure, the
    ally has been captured. If you fail the initial check, the ally is also
    captured. The GM decides who captured the ally and where he or she is being
    held prisoner, but in most cases, the ally can be rescued by a successful
    Rescue Character action.</p>
