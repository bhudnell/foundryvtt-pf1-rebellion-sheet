      this week. That team accomplished its goal, but took significant damage in
      the process. Attempt a DC 20 Security check. If you are successful, the
      team becomes disabled. If you fail this check, the team is destroyed and
      must be replaced. In any event, increase your Notoriety score by
      1d6.</p><p>If no teams were committed to an action during the week, treat
      this event as a result of
