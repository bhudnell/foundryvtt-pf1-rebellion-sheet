      <p>The streets of Kintargo have grown particularly dangerous. For the
      following week (including the next week’s events, if any), increase
      Kintargo’s danger rating by 10. If you roll Dangerous Times twice in one
      Event phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a rebellion
      officer succeeds at a DC 20 Intimidate check to spread word about the
      rebellion’s strength, the danger rating increase is halved.</p>
