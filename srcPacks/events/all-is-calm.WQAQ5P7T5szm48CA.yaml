      <p>No event occurs this week or next week; gain a +1 bonus on all Security
      checks made during the next week. If you roll All Is Calm as a second
      event, it does not cancel the effects of the first event but still
      prevents an event from happening next week. An eventless week caused by
      this event does not raise the chance of an event occurring in the week
      after.</p>
