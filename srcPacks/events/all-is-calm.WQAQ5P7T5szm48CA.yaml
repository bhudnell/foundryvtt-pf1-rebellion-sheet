    <p>No event occurs this week or next week; gain a +1 bonus on all Security
    checks made during the next week. If you roll All Is Calm as a second event,
    it does not cancel the effects of the first event but still prevents an
    event from happening next week. An eventless week caused by this event does
    not raise the chance of an event occurring in the week after.</p>
