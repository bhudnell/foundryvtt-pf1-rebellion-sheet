      <p>One of the Silver Ravens is in fact a magically disguised devil, or has
      been possessed by a diabolic spirit. Roll 1d6; if you roll a 6 (and each
      time thereafter you roll a 6), roll another 1d6 and add those results
      together. The final result tells you the number of weeks that the
      infiltration has persisted unnoticed until this event reveals the truth;
      the infiltration cannot last more weeks than the Silver Ravens have been
      active. Increase you Notoriety score by 1d6 for each week that the
      infiltration was active; a successful DC 15 Loyalty check halves this
      Notoriety gain.</p><p>Mitigation: If an officer makes a successful DC 20
      Sense Motive check, the infiltration is noticed early. Halve all results
      for determining the number of weeks the infiltration has been afflicting
      the rebellion.</p>
