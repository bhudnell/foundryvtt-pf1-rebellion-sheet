  description: >-
    <p>One of the Silver Ravens is in fact a magically disguised devil, or has
    been possessed by a diabolic spirit. Roll 1d6; if you roll a 6 (and each
    time thereafter you roll a 6), roll another 1d6 and add those results
    together. The final result tells you the number of weeks that the
    infiltration has persisted unnoticed until this event reveals the truth; the
    infiltration cannot last more weeks than the Silver Ravens have been active.
    Increase you Notoriety score by 1d6 for each week that the infiltration was
    active; a successful DC 15 Loyalty check halves this Notoriety
    gain.</p><p>Mitigation: If an officer makes a successful DC 20 Sense Motive
    check, the infiltration is noticed early. Halve all results for determining
    the number of weeks the infiltration has been afflicting the rebellion.</p>
