      <p>Contagion has spread through the ranks, leaving your rebels listless
      and sickly. For the next week (including the next week’s events, if any),
      all Security checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll Sickness twice in one
      Event phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens
      officer makes a successful DC 20 Heal check to treat the sickness, this
      penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
