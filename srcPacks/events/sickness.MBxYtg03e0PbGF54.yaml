    <p>Contagion has spread through the ranks, leaving your rebels listless and
    sickly. For the next week (including the next week’s events, if any), all
    Security checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll Sickness twice in one Event
    phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens officer
    makes a successful DC 20 Heal check to treat the sickness, this penalty is
    reduced to –2.</p>
