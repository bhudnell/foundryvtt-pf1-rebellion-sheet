      <p>Randomly determine one of your teams that was committed to an action
      this week. That team accomplished its goal, but soon thereafter went
      missing. The missing team still counts against the maximum number of teams
      the rebellion can have. During the next Upkeep phase, attempt a DC 15
      Security check. If you’re successful, the team is rescued or returns to
      base, but must wait until the next week to be used for rebellion actions.
      If you fail, the team remains missing for another week. If you roll a
      natural 1 on this Security check, the team is lost.</p><p>If no teams were
      committed to an action during the week, treat this event as a result of
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-rebellion-sheet.events.Item.XYaqJw9bEeKA2UzS]{Dangerous
      Times}.</p>
