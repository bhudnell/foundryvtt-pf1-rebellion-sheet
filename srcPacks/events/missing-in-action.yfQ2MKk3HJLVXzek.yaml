  description: >-
    <p>Randomly determine one of your teams that was committed to an action this
    week. That team accomplished its goal, but soon thereafter went missing. The
    missing team still counts against the maximum number of teams the rebellion
    can have. During the next Upkeep phase, attempt a DC 15 Security check. If
    youâ€™re successful, the team is rescued or returns to base, but must wait
    until the next week to be used for rebellion actions. If you fail, the team
    remains missing for another week. If you roll a natural 1 on this Security
    check, the team is lost.</p><p>If no teams were committed to an action
    during the week, treat this event as a result of
    @UUID[Compendium.pf1-rebellion-sheet.events.Item.XYaqJw9bEeKA2UzS]{Dangerous
    Times}.</p>
