      <p>Your supporters have failed in a protest against House Thrune or the
      church of Asmodeus. Reduce your total supporters (and Kintargo’s
      population) by 2d6.</p><p>Mitigation: A successful DC 25 Security check
      negates this reduction. Regardless of that outcome, randomly determine one
      of Kintargo’s settlement modifiers — Corruption, Crime, Economy, Law,
      Lore, or Society. For the next week, this modifier is decreased by 4.</p>
