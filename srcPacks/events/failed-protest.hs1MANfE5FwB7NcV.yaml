    <p>Your supporters have failed in a protest against House Thrune or the
    church of Asmodeus. Reduce your total supporters (and Kintargo’s population)
    by 2d6.</p><p>Mitigation: A successful DC 25 Security check negates this
    reduction. Regardless of that outcome, randomly determine one of Kintargo’s
    settlement modifiers — Corruption, Crime, Economy, Law, Lore, or Society.
    For the next week, this modifier is decreased by 4.</p>
