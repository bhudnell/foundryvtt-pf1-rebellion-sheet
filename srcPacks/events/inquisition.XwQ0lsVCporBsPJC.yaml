    <p>Thrune and the church have grown tired of the rebellion, and for the
    following week, the rebellion loses twice as many supporters as indicated
    whenever supporters are lost. In addition, the bonuses and penalties applied
    to Kintargo’s modifiers by the city’s martial law disadvantage are doubled
    for the week. If you roll Inquisition twice in one Event phase, it becomes
    persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: By taking the Lie Low action, the rebellion
    can end a persistent Inquisition by making a successful DC 20 Secrecy
    check.</p>
