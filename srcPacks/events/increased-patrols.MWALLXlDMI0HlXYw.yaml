      <p>Dottari patrols on the streets of Kintargo are increased this week,
      resulting in heightened security. For the next week (including the next
      week’s events, if any), all Secrecy checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll
      Increased Patrols twice in one Event phase, it becomes
      persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens officer makes a
      successful DC 20 Survival check to study the patrol routes and interpret
      the patterns, this penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
