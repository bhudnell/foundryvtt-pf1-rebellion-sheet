  description: >-
    <p>Dottari patrols on the streets of Kintargo are increased this week,
    resulting in heightened security. For the next week (including the next
    week’s events, if any), all Secrecy checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll
    Increased Patrols twice in one Event phase, it becomes
    persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If a Silver Ravens officer makes a successful
    DC 20 Survival check to study the patrol routes and interpret the patterns,
    this penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
