      <p>Things in Kintargo have begun to overwhelm the rebels with a sense of
      hopelessness and despair. For the next week (including the next week’s
      events, if any), all Loyalty checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll Low
      Morale twice in one Event phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation:
      If a Silver Ravens officer makes a successful DC 20 Perform check to
      entertain the rebels and raise spirits, this penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
