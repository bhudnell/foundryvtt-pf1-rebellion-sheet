    <p>Things in Kintargo have begun to overwhelm the rebels with a sense of
    hopelessness and despair. For the next week (including the next week’s
    events, if any), all Loyalty checks take a –4 penalty. If you roll Low
    Morale twice in one Event phase, it becomes persistent.</p><p>Mitigation: If
    a Silver Ravens officer makes a successful DC 20 Perform check to entertain
    the rebels and raise spirits, this penalty is reduced to –2.</p>
