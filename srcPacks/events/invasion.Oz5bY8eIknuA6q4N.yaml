  description: >-
    <p>A dangerous creature has invaded! The GM rolls or selects a wandering
    monster from the encounter tables available to her in the adventures, and
    you must step in to fight this intruder. The location in which the invasion
    occurs is selected by the GM. If you choose not to deal with the invader in
    person, the Silver Ravens themselves handle the situation, but in doing so,
    1d4 randomly determined teams are lost and 1d4 randomly determined teams are
    disabled. In addition, the partyâ€™s failure to handle the invader causes the
    rebellion to gain a persistent
    @UUID[Compendium.pf1-rebellion-sheet.events.Item.Dwuum6chASrAjU0c]{Low
