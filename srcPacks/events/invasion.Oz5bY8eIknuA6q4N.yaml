  description:
    value: >-
      <p>A dangerous creature has invaded! The GM rolls or selects a wandering
      monster from the encounter tables available to her in the adventures, and
      you must step in to fight this intruder. The location in which the
      invasion occurs is selected by the GM. If you choose not to deal with the
      invader in person, the Silver Ravens themselves handle the situation, but
      in doing so, 1d4 randomly determined teams are lost and 1d4 randomly
      determined teams are disabled. In addition, the party’s failure to handle
      the invader causes the rebellion to gain a persistent
      @UUID[Compendium.pf1-rebellion-sheet.events.Item.Dwuum6chASrAjU0c]{Low
      Morale} event.</p><p></p>
